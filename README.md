MyDiaryApp is a web app in which users can create and maintain multiple diaries. Users can add entries to each diary, choosing what content to contain in each entry, whether it be a text entry and/or photos. Users can also create their own tags by which to categorize their entries in a given diary. Entries can be sorted via selections from a drop-down menu, as well as searched by tag or keyword.
